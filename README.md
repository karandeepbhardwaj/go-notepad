# Build Your Own Go NotePad üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®

## Chapter 1: The Quest Begins

In the beginning, there was the Terminal, and it was good. But lo, we sought to make it even better by using Go to create a note pad application. For this grand quest, you'll need:

- A dash of Go knowledge (fear not, brave soul, for beginners are welcome!)
- The Go language installed in your trusty steed (your computer)
- A heart full of courage (and maybe some coffee)

### Step 1.1: Setting Up Your Enchanted Workspace

Open your Terminal or Command Prompt and chant the following incantation:

```sh
mkdir go-note-pad && cd go-note-pad
go mod init go-note-pad
```

Behold! Your module, `go-note-pad`, is born.

### Step 1.2: Summoning the Main File

Create a file named `main.go`. This is where the magic happens.

```sh
touch main.go
```

### Step 1.3: The Note Struct - A Parchment for Your Thoughts

Within `main.go`, declare a structure that shall hold your musings:

```go
package main

import "time"

// Note - A mystical container for your thoughts
type Note struct {
    ID        int
    Title     string
    Content   string
    CreatedAt time.Time
    UpdatedAt time.Time
}
```

## Chapter 2: The Four Sacred Commands

Our application shall heed four sacred commands: Create, List, View, and Delete. Like the four winds, they breathe life into our application.

### The Create Spell

```go
// In a real app, this function would save to a database
// But in our magical realm, we're printing to the console
func createNote(title, content string) {
    fmt.Printf("A new note titled '%s' has been created with content:\n%s\n", title, content)
}
```

### The List Enchantment

```go
// This potent spell lists all your notes
// Imagine it reading from a database of limitless knowledge
func listNotes() {
    fmt.Println("Behold! Your notes stretch out before you, endless as the stars...")
}
```

### The View Invocation

```go
// Here, you'd fetch a single note by its ID and reveal its secrets
func viewNote(id int) {
    fmt.Printf("The contents of note %d are profound and full of mystery...\n", id)
}
```

### The Delete Hex

```go
// With a heavy heart, you may occasionally need to banish a note into the void
func deleteNote(id int) {
    fmt.Printf("Note %d has been consigned to oblivion...\n", id)
}
```

## Chapter 3: The Database Dungeon

Fear not, for now, we venture into the dungeon of `dbdiagrams.io` to etch our database schema into the stone of eternity.

Behold our schema, a simple table of `notes`:

```
Table notes {
  id int [pk, increment]
  title varchar
  content text
  created_at datetime
  updated_at datetime
}
```

## Chapter 4: The Grand Integration

Armed with our schema, we'd typically use a spell like `database/sql` to connect to our database. However, since integrating a real database might anger the demo gods, let's pretend our functions are now fully integrated, calling upon the ancient libraries of SQLite, PostgreSQL, or the like.

```go
// Imagine these functions now talk to a database
// Through mystical portals like database/sql and pq
```

## Chapter 5: The User Interface - A Portal to Power

Our journey nears its end as we craft a simple CLI, a portal through which users can wield the power of the Four Sacred Commands. The `main` function becomes our command center:

```go
func main() {
    // Here, in the real world, you'd loop and accept user input
    // For each command, invoking the appropriate magic
    fmt.Println("Welcome, traveler, to the Go Note Pad.")
    fmt.Println("Your commands are: Create, List, View, Delete.")
}
```

## Epilogue: The Quest Never Ends

Congratulations, intrepid coder! You've journeyed far and learned much. But remember, the path of a coder is endless. There are always new spells to learn, dungeons to explore, and applications to build.

- Experiment with real databases.
- Enhance your CLI with libraries like `cobra` or `urfave/cli`.
- Maybe even conjure a GUI with `fyne` or `gioui` for your application.

May your bugs be few, and your coffee cup never empty. Happy coding! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíªüöÄ
